# :japanese_castle: React-Three-Next starter

A minimalist starter for NextJS, @react-three/fiber and Threejs.

- TTL ~ 100ms
- First load JS ~¬†79kb
- Lighthouse score of 100 (Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO)

This starter allows you to navigate seamlessly between pages with dynamic dom and/or canvas content without reloading or creating a new canvas every time. 3D components are usable anywhere in the dom. The events, dom, viewport, everything is synchronized!

### ‚ö´ Demo :

### :bullettrain_side: Architecture

Thanks to [tunnel-rat](https://github.com/pmndrs/tunnel-rat) the starter can portal components between separate renderers. Anything rendered inside the `<View/>` component of the starter will be rendered in the 3D Context. For better performances it uses gl.scissor to cut the viewport into segments.

```jsx
<div className='relative'>
  <View orbit className='relative sm:h-48 sm:w-full'>
    <Dog scale={2} />
    // Some 3D components will be rendered here
  </View>
</div>
```

### :control_knobs: Available Scripts

- `yarn dev` - Next dev
- `yarn analyze` - Generate bundle-analyzer
- `yarn lint` - Audit code quality
- `yarn build` - Next build
- `yarn start` - Next start
