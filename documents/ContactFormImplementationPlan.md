# Contact Form Implementation Plan

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the plan for implementing a reusable contact form component for our Next.js website. The component will be designed to be highly configurable, reusable across multiple projects, and will include webhook integration for form submissions.

## 2. Objectives

- Create a reusable contact form component that can be easily integrated into any page
- Implement configurable webhook submission functionality
- Maintain the visual identity and styling of the main website
- Ensure the component is fully responsive and accessible
- Allow for easy customization of form fields, styling, and behavior

## 3. Directory Structure

```
src/
└── templates/
    ├── ContactForm.jsx       # Main reusable component
    └── hooks/
        └── useFormSubmission.jsx  # Custom hook for form submission
```

## 4. Technical Implementation

### 4.1 Component API

The component will have the following API:

```jsx
<ContactForm
  isVisible={boolean}         // Controls visibility of the form
  onClose={function}          // Function to call when form is closed
  hookUrl={string}            // URL for the webhook to submit form data
  title={string}              // Optional - Form title
  position={string}           // Optional - 'right', 'left', 'center'
  theme={object}              // Optional - Theme colors
  submitButtonText={string}   // Optional - Button text
  initialValues={object}      // Optional - Pre-fill form values
  additionalFields={array}    // Optional - Custom fields
  successMessage={string}     // Optional - Success message
/>
```

### 4.2 Form Structure

The form will include these standard fields by default:
- Name (required)
- Email (required)
- Message (required)

Additional custom fields can be added through the `additionalFields` prop.

### 4.3 Webhook Integration

The component will include a configurable webhook submission system:

1. Form data will be collected and validated
2. On successful validation, data will be submitted to the specified webhook URL
3. Success/error states will be managed and displayed appropriately
4. Optional pre/post-submission hooks can be provided for data transformation or additional actions

### 4.4 Animation and Styling

The component will maintain the current visual style with:
- Sliding animations for entry/exit
- Hover effects on form fields
- Themed styling based on the main website's design
- Support for different positioning (right, left, center)

## 5. UI/UX Considerations

- The form should maintain the same visual identity as the main website
- Include appropriate animations for a smooth user experience
- Ensure proper feedback for form validation and submission
- Implement responsive design for all devices
- Include loading states during submission
- Provide clear success/error messages

## 6. Accessibility Considerations

- Ensure proper ARIA attributes are used
- Implement keyboard navigation
- Include focus management
- Provide clear error messages for form validation
- Ensure color contrast meets WCAG standards

## 7. Testing Strategy

- Test form validation for all fields
- Verify form submission with different webhook URLs
- Test responsiveness on different devices and screen sizes
- Validate accessibility using automated tools
- Test different configurations of the component

## 8. Migration Plan

- Extract the current contact form from app/page.jsx
- Create the reusable component in src/templates
- Update app/page.jsx to use the new component
- Document the component API and usage examples

## 9. Future Enhancements

- Add internationalization support
- Implement file upload capability
- Add custom validation rules
- Create a visual form builder
- Add analytics integration

## 10. Timeline

- Phase 1 (Component Structure): 1 day
- Phase 2 (Form Functionality): 1-2 days
- Phase 3 (Styling and Animation): 1 day
- Phase 4 (Testing and Refinement): 1 day

Total estimated time: 4-5 days
